    <h1>DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h1>
    <h2>What is DBMS?</h2>
    <p>
        Database Management System (DBMS) refers to the technology solution used to optimize and manage the storage and retrieval of data from databases. DBMS offers a systematic approach to manage databases via an interface for users as well as workloads accessing the databases via apps.
        The management responsibilities for DBMS encompass information within the databases, the processes applied to databases (such as access and modification), and the database’s logic structure. DBMS also facilitates additional administrative operations such as change management, disaster recovery, compliance, and performance monitoring, among others.
    </p>
    <h2>Benefits of DBMS</h2>
    <p>
        DBMS was designed to solve the fundamental problems associated with storing, managing, accessing, securing, and auditing data in traditional file systems. Traditional database applications were developed on top of the databases, which led to challenges such as data redundancy, isolation, integrity constraints, and difficulty managing data access.
        A layer of abstraction was required between users or apps and the databases at a physical and logical level.
